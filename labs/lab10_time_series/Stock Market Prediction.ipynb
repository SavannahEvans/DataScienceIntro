    "The main idea is to use world major stock indices as input features for the machine learning based predictor. The intuition behind this approach is that globalization has deepened the interaction between financial markets around the world. Shock wave of US financial crisis (from Lehman Brothers crack) hit the economy of almost every country and debt crisis originated in Greece brought down all major stock indices. Nowadays, no financial market is isolated. Economic data, political perturbation and any other oversea affairs could cause dramatic fluctuation in domestic markets. A “bad day” on the Australian or Japanese exchange is going to heavily affect Wall Street opening and trend. In the light of the previous considerations the following predictors have been selected:\n",

    "Tokyo Nikkei-225 (^N225 Yahoo Finance)\n",
    "Hong Kong Hang Seng (^HSI Yahoo Finance)\n",
    "Australia ASX-200 (^AXJO Yahoo Finance)\n",
    "It is very easy to get historical daily prices of the previous indices. Python provides easy libraries to handle the download. The data can be pulled down from Yahoo Finance or Quandl and cleanly formatted into a dataframe with the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Date : in days\n",
    "Open : price of the stock at the opening of the trading (in US dollars)\n",
    "High : highest price of the stock during the trading day (in US dollars)\n",
    "Low : lowest price of the stock during the trading day (in US dollars)\n",
    "Close : price of the stock at the closing of the trading (in US dollars)\n",

    "Adj Close : price of the stock at the closing of the trading adjusted with dividends (in US dollars)\n",
