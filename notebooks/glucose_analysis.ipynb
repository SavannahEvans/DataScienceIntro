    "A [CDC Report](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0718-diabetes-report.html) \"finds that as of 2015, 30.3 million Americans – 9.4 percent of the U.S. population –have diabetes. Another 84.1 million have prediabetes, a condition that if not treated often leads to type 2 diabetes within five years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When we eat food, carbohydrates in the food are converted into glucose, a type of sugar, that floats in our blood.  In a healthy person, the pancreas and liver regulate the concentration of glucose by releasing insulin and stored glucose, respectively.  Insulin triggers the body's cells to absorb the glucose floating in the blood stream.  Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels due to reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance).  Insulin resistance can be made worse when a person is overweight.  Blood sugar is often measured by a device called a glucometer using a blood sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diet and exercise are used as a first line defense for managing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.  Diet and exercise impact glucose levels directly and indirectly.  High carbohydrates foods like candy, potatoes, or bread can spike blood sugar levels; foods with complex carbohydrates such as whole wheat bread or sweed potatoes tend to be digested more slowly, leading to smoother blood sugar levels. Exercise can reduce blood sugar levels temporarily by causing cells to absorb glucose in the blood without needing insulin.  Longer term, proper diet and consistent exercise can help type 2 diabetics lose weight and consequently, reduce insulin resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll analyze glucose readings from a type 2 diabetic taken over the summer of 2016.  The data set contains a timestamp (date and time), glucose level, and whether or not the person engaged in a physical activity before the reading was taken.  We'll analyze this data set to determine the seasonality in the blood glucose levels and the impact of exercise on blood glucose levels."
